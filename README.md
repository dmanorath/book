BookFinder is an application which helps students save money.

Our application will allow students buy or sell their text books locally (within their university or college).
Users will be required to sign in using their college's email address.

We have used SQL Workbench, Python, CSS, HTML and RESTFUL APIs

Benefits of using BookFinder:
Students can get rid of old textbook and earn cash.
It will be competitive so buyers will pay less.
It will be within the university so it will be a simple cash/exchange transaction.

Our application is still under development as we are constantly working hard to make it more secured and simple to use.
